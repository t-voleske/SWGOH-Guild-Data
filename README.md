# SWGOH Guild Data

A project to gather, process, and manage data from the game **Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH)** for guild management and spreadsheet reporting.

## Features

- **Automated Data Collection:** Fetches player, guild, and raid data via API requests, as well as .csv imports.
- **Database Integration:** Reads from and writes to a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.
- **Containerization:** Runs in a docker container with dependencies managed through UV and environment variables imported at run-time. 
- **Spreadsheet Sync:** Updates Google Sheets with the latest guild and player statistics.
- **Logging & Error Handling:** Configurable logging for debugging and monitoring.
- **Roster & Ticket Tracking:** Tracks player activity, raid scores, tickets, and roster requirements.
- **Data Archiving:** Archives players who have left the guild and removes them from the active members tables.

## Data Sources & Dependencies

This project uses a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage and easy access to prepared views to display on google spreadsheets. Most of the data is fetched automatically through a locally hosted version of the [swgoh-comlink](https://github.com/swgoh-utils/swgoh-comlink) API, which serves mostly publicly available game data. <br>
To ensure accuracy, ticket data is retrieved within a few minutes of the guild reset every day. TB data has to be manually exported from other tools like HotUtils and can then be imported to the database.<br>
The database, API and scheduled python programs are hosted on local hardware. 

## Spreadsheet View Example

<img src="assets/spreadsheet_example.png" alt="An example of the main spreadsheet view" width="80%">

The main view combines the most important metrics, so they are visible at a glance. For a deeper dive into the different topics, there are more detailed views available. <br>
(Information that could potentially identify an individual has been anonymized for this example.)

## Reproducing the project

This is meant solely as a personal project at this point. I will not actively support replication efforts, but you are welcome to ask questions.
Please open an issue, if you have any inquiries.
